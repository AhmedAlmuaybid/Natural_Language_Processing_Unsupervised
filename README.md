# Natural_Language_Processing_Unsupervised
As any data since we all used the magical website called stack overflow those who don't know stack Overflow. Stack Overflow provides one of the largest question and answers platforms for programmers. Users post questions and their fellow peers try to provide solutions in the best way possible.

 In our project, we want to help the people ask the right question in the correct way. we will achieve that by using natural language process (NLP) to find the best format for the questions. In addition, a  recommendation system can be built to help the user write the optimal question format that can help fellow peers understand the question.
